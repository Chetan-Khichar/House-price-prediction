# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of rooms, and more. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates property prices using supervised learning techniques.

Key Highlights:

Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis

Applied and compared multiple ML models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Evaluated model performance using RMSE and RÂ² score

Tools used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
